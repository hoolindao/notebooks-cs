|-----------------------------|
| APPS: Bull's Eye            |
| 1. think like a programmer  |
| 2. plan my programmer tasks |
| 3. use Xcode                |
| 4. interface Builder        |
| 5. basics of coding for iOS |

- "what" comes first
- "分而治之" can deal with complexity
***** todo
- build an one-button app
***** tips
- exit an app
  - on phone, use home button
  - on simulator, use shift+com+H shortcut
***** follow setps && questions
****** Chapter 1 to 2 : One-Button APP
- creat a new Xcode project of iOS with swift language

  - what the difference between phone and simulator?
  - [[*what happens when I press Run?][what happens when I press Run?]]
- add a button
  - what is "storyboard" mean?
  - sum up this step
  - meet the problem: how can I change the size of my button?
- make it -- when the button is tapped, show an alert popup with a simple text message "Hello, World!"
  - in this step, I meet The source code editor
    - [[*how can I make Xcode to show the Line numbers of the code?][how can I make Xcode to show the Line numbers of the code?]]
    - what the keywords of "@IBAction" and "func" mean?
    - press cmd+s to save the files
  - [[*what is view controller?][what is view controller?]]
  - [[*how can make the connection to link two action?][how can make the connection to link two action?]]
  - finish the instructions and figure out it's meaning
  - tips: cmd key to see the whole brock and Issue navigator
  - how can I see the Errors Xcode noticed for me, and what the difference between Errors and Warnings?
- do the anatomy of an app with author
  -
  - list the objects that provided by iOS and program by myself
  - try to answer why should func Return value?
  - how can I see the Source code of an object?
****** Chapter 3
- what difference between points and pixels, why 640x1136 pixels equal 568x320 points?
***** answer
****** 不小心创建成  object-c 项目会怎么样？
see ViewController.h and ViewController.m instead of ViewController.swift
****** what happens when I press Run?
1. Xcode compile my source code : translate it from Swift into machine code
2. put the source files, images, storyboard files and so on together with the binary code into the "application bundle"
3. Xcode copies the application bundle to machine
4. run

- why bother?
  - phone or simulator can understand machine code only
  - all the stuff run the app need should put it together with order
****** sum up this step
1. select Main.storyboard from Project navigator, then the main editing pane transforms into the Interface Builder
2. I can make the pane layout by clicking the Hider or show utilities in toolbar
3. if I want to see the border of my button, using the Editor -> Canvas -> Show Bounds Rectangles
****** how can I make Xcode to show the Line numbers of the code?
Choose Xcode -> Prefences -> Text Editing for the menu bar , then check the Line numbers
****** what is view controller?
A view controlller iss to manage a single screen in app

(take an example to understand this sentence, the two view controller of the cookbook app)

- One of the design principles of iOS is
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
each screen in app gets its own view controlller
#+END_QUOTE

- A view controlller support files is the storyboard and the Swift file which together form it's design and implementation
****** how can make the connection to link two action?
Hold down the Control key then clik the button to selct and drag up to the View Controller item, then can see a small menu appear after let go of the mouse button. select "showAlert" from the menu under "sent Events"

(or I can hold down the right-click instead of Control key)

Asing "sent Events", I told the Xcode to make a connection between the button and the line @IBAction func showAlert.

And I can see the connection in Connection inspector
****** finish the instructions and figure out it's meaning
#+BEGIN_SRC
@IBAction func showAlert() {
  let alert = UIAlerController(title: "Hello, World", message: "This is my first app!", preferredStyle: .alert)

  let action = UIAlerAction(title: "Awesome", style: .default, handler: nil)

  alert.addAction(action)

  present(alert, animated: true, completion: nil)
}
#+END_SRC
****** what is an app ?
- made up of objects than can sent messages to each other
- In iOS, apps are event-driven, which means everthings my app doses is triggered by some event
  - source of events:
    - most improtant: user touches and taps
    - other types of events: the operating system
      - for example: incoming phone call, WiFi connection
